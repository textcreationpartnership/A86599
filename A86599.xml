            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If you can caſt it into a better mould, it ſhall receive another anſwer. Now to prove, that no infants were baptized here (though you ſay not ſo, as in the place foregoing) thus perhaps you may bee thought to reaſon.

                  <p n="2">2. If Repentance and Baptiſm be an orderly profeſſion of Faith, then not Baptiſme alone; and if ſo, Then Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm doth not conſtitute a Chriſtian. For the cauſe muſt not be partial, but total, which compleats the effect.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Repentance and Baptiſm are not of the like neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, though you conjoin them: Without Repentance adult people cannot be ſaved; no ſuch thing can be truly ſaid of Baptiſm.

                  <p n="1">1. The Major is granted, if it be underſtood of imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate preſent exhortation, to every particular member of that Church without exception.

It was enough that it was directed to the principal members (which oft have the denomination of the whole) by whom it might be (as there was occaſion) communicated to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:119011:104"/>The Apoſtle calls this Church (for all whom hee gives thanks, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4.) Brethren, will it follow therefore, that Women among them (who are not brethren) are not Church-members?</p>

                  <p n="2">2. This Argument is like the former, and therefore the ſame anſwer might ſerve. This Exhortation was directly and immediately given to perſons of years; yet remotely to the children of the faithful, who were bound to bring
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:119011:105"/>them up (when grown) as <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Iſraelites did theirs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. of <hi>Abraham,</hi> I ſay; for of his chiefly the Author ſpeaks, <hi>ver.</hi> 12, 13, &amp;c.</p>

Again, If make Diſciples All Nations, and teach all Nations be all one, as M. <hi>Baxter</hi> affirms, then it is clear, that Diſciples are made by preaching the Word, But Infants that underſtand not earthly things, if we tell them, can much leſs underſtand the things of the kingdom of heaven, declared by the preaching of the Goſpell.

                     <hi>Reply</hi> 1. You ſtill forget the work you had underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, which was to anſwer: but inſtead of anſwering the Arguments brought to prove Infants-Diſciple-ſhip, you
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:119011:107"/>take the opponents place, and ſay, you will prove, that they are not, cannot be Diſciples.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Your Argument here is like that earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. without Form, and voyd, confuſed Chaos, without head or foot, in no mood or figure, (as Logicians know) and therefore I have tranſcribed it at large (only paring away ſome ſuperfluous words) that all may ſee what a Babel you have built.</p>

But alſo ſomtimes to bee made and to bee born is all one. Chriſt himſelf was made King, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.6. I have ſet (or as the word is, annointed) my King—and yet hee was born King, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.2. Where is he that is born King—? Say the wiſe men.

The ſame in another phraſe with this here in <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. with an Emphaſis on THE, <hi>i. e.</hi> the expected King or Meſſias. Onely it's clear, that Chriſt in God's wiſe and eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, was made a King, and yet born a King: And to put it out of doubt, Chriſt is ſaid to be made of a woman—<hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.16.

                  <p n="4">4. As for the Apoſtles making Diſciples by teaching, &amp;c.

The Diſciples of Chriſt can deny themſelves, take up the Croſs and follow Chriſt. It's like this. Subjects can fight for their Prince. Infants can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. Therefore— If the Propoſition bee underſtood of all, it's falſe. If of ſome, then the Syllogiſm is falſe for form, as before.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For <hi>Acts</hi> 15. It's granted p. 16.—by M. <hi>B.</hi> that they who heard the Word, &amp;c. were Diſciples, but not onely they; and M. <hi>B.</hi> prove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Reply</hi> 1.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply</hi> 1. I have joined theſe two Arguments together; for being the ſams form, they may receive the ſame an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. 1. The Syllogiſms themſelvs are falſe for Form, as a Freſh-man in Logick may ſee, (for they are both in the firſt Figure, having the Aſſumptions Negative) and the meaneſt rational man may diſcern, thus: They who have perfectly learned all the Liberal Arts and Sciences, are Scholars indeed: But Abecedarians have not learned all the Liberal Arts and Sciences; Therefore they are not Scholars indeed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Here is a Fallacie<note n="*" place="margin">Ignoratio E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenchi.</note>, for our queſtion is not of ſuch Diſciples who are truly Regenerate, and ſhall be certainly fruitful, &amp;c. which belongs onely to the inviſible Church. Wee never affirmed that all the children of believing pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are ſuch—But our Queſtion is concerning thoſe that are viſible Diſciples, in his viſible School, &amp;c. And you cannot deny, many may and muſt be owned diſciples in the Viſible Church, who fall ſhort of thoſe viſible cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters; as <hi>Judas, Simon Magus, Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphirae,</hi> &amp;c. This your arguing then, makes as much againſt the Primitive Apoſtolical Churches, as againſt ours. For they did not ſtay from owning people Diſciples, till they knew whether they would continue in the Word, and bring forth much fruit to God's glory.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. The Aſſumptions in both (taken univerſally) are not true; for <hi>Jacob, Jeremy, John</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>Timothy,</hi> &amp;c. even from children abode in the truth, and perſevered to glorifie God. And it's not impoſſible now; but in regard of the promiſe, we may judge it uſual in many Infants, though not all. This is enough: For there was never any ſociety or Church of Men-diſciples on earth, of which any man could ſay infallibly, that all of them were truly ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply</hi> 1. This is ſick of the ſame diſeaſe with the two former: For
<list>
                        <item>1. It hath a Negative Aſſumption in the firſt Figure, like this: They that write in the Hebrew and Greek Languages are known to be Scholars: But they that are in ſome (womans) Country-ſchool cannot do ſo; Therefore no Scholars.</item>
                        <item>2. The Queſtion is not of thoſe true, real, internal Diſciples, taught of God to love one another with a ſupernatural love, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. (for perſons of any falſe Religion, may love one another with a carnal, and natural love) for theſe ſhall not be known of all men till the day of judgment, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.31, 32, &amp;c. But our Queſtion is concerning viſible Diſciples, who are to bee eſteemed members in the School of the viſible Church on earth, and to have Baptiſm the ſign of Admiſſion into his School. Will you take none to be Chriſt's Diſciples, and to be baptized, untill they be known by all men to love one another, as Chriſt loved his people? If ſo, you muſt ceaſe (to the worlds end) from gathering Churches. Was not <hi>Judas</hi> a Diſciple of Chriſt? and yet he had no true love to Chriſt, or to his fellow-diſciples?</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:119011:116"/>
                  <p n="2">2. Though this is one mark by which true diſciples may be known by them who can diſcern, as a man's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed conſcience in this world, and all men at the laſt day; yet this is not the onely mark (others have been na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med before) much leſſe is it the onely mark of <hi>That</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipleſhip, which is neceſſary to make a member of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Doubtleſs many Infants of viſible Church-members are regenerated, and ſanctified, or indued with the Holy Ghoſt; ſo that if they ſhould live to years, they would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually love Chriſt and his members with a ſpiritual love. Therefore having this love wrought in them by God's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſeminally, radically, or habitually (though they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not actually put it forth as grown perſons); they may not be judged altogether to want this love, as may appear by the fore-named inſtances, ſpecially of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.15, 41, 44.

                     <hi>Reply</hi> 1. Beſide the ſame diſeaſes that this Argument is ſick of (which for brevity I repeat not) 1. The Word [Diſciples] is not in the premiſſes, nor in this Scripture (though the Diſciples were concerned) on which one or both ſhould be grounded; therefore (by your Anſwer, p. 80) to be ſleighted.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply</hi> 1.

Yea above many Prophets and righteous men, who (in this reſpect) were not Diſciples (in regard of the clear diſcovery of thoſe myſteries, <hi>verſe</hi> 17.) but <hi>Judas</hi> was not bleſſed. If you take Diſciples in this (which is the moſt proper and immediate) ſenſe. The Concluſion will bee, that Infants (while ſuch) were none of thoſe Twelve (or rather Eleven) bleſſed Diſciplet, which is granted.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It may be granted (in a good ſenſe) that what was immediately ſpoken to thoſe Diſciples, may be applied to others, <hi>viz.</hi> to all the Elect in Goſpel-times, who upon hearing of the Word are ſavingly inlightned, as may be gathered, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.12, 16, 17.

                        <hi>H. H. p. 86.</hi> I proceed to anſwer M. <hi>Baxter's</hi> eight Arguments, by which <hi>(he ſaith)</hi> he proveth the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt's way of baptizing ſinfull. His firſt is this:
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:119011:119"/>There is no word of precept or example in all the Scripture for the baptizing of the child of any one Chriſtian at years of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. Therefore to defer the baptizing them till then, is not the Scripture way. <hi>Anſwer, page 87.</hi> I give him an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt, who was baptized at years of diſcretion, <hi>Luk. 3.21, 22.</hi> If M. <hi>Baxter</hi> deny his mother to be a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, <hi>Luk. 1.46, 46.</hi> I ſay he knows not what a Chriſtian is, and is no Chriſtian himſelf. But to retort, there is no word of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept nor example in all the Scripture for baptizing an Infant; Therefore that way is ſinfull.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply</hi> 1. If by Chriſtian, you mean the name or title, I will be bold to ſay, (without danger of your charge) that <hi>Mary</hi> was no Chriſtian; for the Diſciples were called Chriſtians, FIRST in <hi>Antioch, Acts</hi> 11.26. And I would gladly know whether you do, or dare judge (to uſe your own expreſſion) <hi>Mary</hi> the mother of Jeſus to be no Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. If you deny, I am bold to ſay you erre, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures, you know not what a Diſciple is, and that you are none your ſelf. But if you underſtand the ſubſtance and truth (as I may ſay) of a Chriſtian, I cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially acknowledge her a Chriſtian. The name Proteſtant was not uſed till about <hi>Luther's</hi> time, yet our Divines prove ſoundly againſt the Papiſts, that the Proteſtant Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, (<hi>i. e.</hi> The ſubſtance of our Religion) was profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and practiſed long before, even from the time of Chriſt and his Apoſtles to <hi>Luther</hi>'s days. This is helpfull, not hurtfull to us; but hurtfull, not helpfull to you. For as it ſhews that (for ſubſtance) the Covenant of grace under the Old and New Teſtament is one and the ſame, though different in manner of adminiſtration (as hath been proved); ſo the ſame ſeal of initiation, though in a different way of diſpenſation—</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As the mother of Jeſus was a Chriſtian (So <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> even in his mothers womb, may bee called a Chriſtian, who is ſaid to leap for joy, the ſame word with <hi>Maries</hi> rejoicing, (onely there,<note n="z)" place="margin">Luk. 1.44. <gap reason="foreign">

And thus all the faithfull of the Old Teſtament were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians). Now if you prove by conſequence from that Scripture, and truly, that <hi>Mary</hi> was a Chriſtian, becauſe ſhee rejoiced in Chriſt—May not wee prove Infant-Baptiſm, &amp;c. by conſequence from Scripture too? What? will you not give YET that liberty, which you take?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For that in <hi>Luke</hi> 3. concerning Chriſt his being baptized, I have ſpoken ſufficiently to it, (and will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat) in your page 38.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Though the Texts alledged by you have been Reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, yet here your anſwer is both wide and weak. If you mean of a Church to be conſtituted, that's nothing to the purpoſe. Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> aſſertion is ſtill true, though that be granted, and ſo your anſwer is wide. If of a Church conſtituted, and if you underſtand chriſtians chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren at age, then your inſtances out of thoſe Scriptures prove no ſuch thing, becauſe they were not the children of Chriſtian parents, and ſo your anſwer is weak.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As your anſwer is impertinent, ſo your return of M. <hi>Baxter's</hi> Argument is inſufficient. To deal roundly. I deny your Minor. <hi>viz.</hi> There is Scripture rule for Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing babes (notwithſtanding your impudent denying it) as may be eaſily diſcerned by any who ſeriouſly, and impartially peruſe Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> Book, or this Reply; neither do you bring any Scriptures to prove your Minor, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, I SAY. What arrogancy is this in you, to obtrude an opinion on the world upon your bare word? Could you perſwade me that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was a Dipper, and that his ſoul had tranſmigrated into your body, I would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the <hi>Haggarens</hi> as well as the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> an IPSE DIXIT, he hath ſaid it, and that's enough. Do you think to carry your cauſe, againſt the evidence of Scripture, practice of Antiquity, conſent of Fathers, continued cuſtom of the Churches, ſtrength of reaſon, upon ſuch a pitifull proof as this is, I SAY? How long is it ſince your confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath amounted to an Infallibility? I therefore muſt make bold (your premiſſes being thus routed) to alter

For although you are not ſo rigid to damne Infants, and exclude them from Heaven, yet you excommunicate them out of the Church, caſt them out of the Covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here I argue: They who may be ſaved without actuall Faith, may be Baptized without actuall faith: But Infants (ſpecially of believing parents) may be ſaved without actuall faith, therefore they may be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized without actuall faith. The Minor you grant. The Major I prove thus. If faith be as neceſſary to ſalvation, as it is to Baptiſme, then they that may be ſaved without faith, may be Baptiſed without Faith. But the former is true, Therefore the latter. The conſequence of the Major is evident from the words of the text,<note n="f)" place="margin">Mark 16.16.</note> where the ſame ſtreſſe is laid upon faith to ſalvation, as to Baptiſme. And the Minor cannot be denied unleſſe you will have admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to Baptiſm on Earth, more difficult then to bleſſedneſs in Heaven; and make it an harder matter to be Baptized, then to be Saved.

                  <p n="2">2. We do not blame you ſimply for Dipping, but for making it Eſſential to the Ordinance. No Dipping, no Baptizing, is your crie; Jeſus Chriſt hath no where limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Baptizing to the mode and externality of Dipping. And the Catechiſm which you cite ſaith expreſly, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is baptized by Dipping, or Sprinkling; which disjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you have left out.</p>

If ſprinkling (you ſay) be neither dipping nor waſhing, then we have deluded the people all this while, &amp;c. But I aſſume, ſprinkling is waſhing (as is proved); Then by your own arguing we have not deluded the people, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill unbaptized: but rather you delude the people by your ſilly ſophiſtry, and bearing them in hand, that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing ſignifies onely dipping.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Your third Inference is as weak, being without Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and reaſon.
<list>
                        <item>1. You bring no Scripture to prove the word baptizing ſignifies a waſhing by dipping, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>It muſt needs be,</hi> which is not a ſufficient (much leſſe a Scripture) proof. Thus your great weapon <hi>(Neceſſity)</hi> is ſoon blunted. But I will give you a Scripture or two, that holds forth a Waſhing, but not by Dipping, (or as you ſay, wetting all over). It's ſaid <hi>Mark</hi> 7.4. <hi>When

                        <item>2. Your inference is with ſome reaſon, but a ſilly one. For who can waſh a thing that is not wet? It ſtuck in your teeth, you durſt not ſpeak out <hi>All over,</hi> as immediately before. For you can waſh off a ſpot from the face of your child, though the face be not wet all over. Again, how poorly do you confound Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and wetting all over? when the tip of your ſinger may be dipt in water, and yet the finger not wet all over. I muſt now needs tell you, if your zeal for Dipping be no better then your Argument, it will ſhrink in the wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</item>

                     <hi>Reply</hi> 1. Let the Reader obſerve, that Mr. <hi>Haggar</hi> paſſeth by ſome Arguments of M. <hi>Baxter's</hi> without mentioning them. Thus he onely ſtorms the Rear, that he may ſcape the Van.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It's granted, that Chriſt's waſhing of the Diſciples feet was to teach them humility, and it follows (by what you grant here) that waſhing of a part, ſhews the waſhing of the whole (which is contradictory to what you even now ſaid, that it muſt needs be, that waſhing is by wetting <hi>All over</hi>). Pride is a ſpreading ſin, it's in the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.3. in the ſpirit, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.8. in the heart, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. <hi>ver.</hi> 5. in the tongue, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.3. in looks, <hi>Prov,</hi> 6.17. in geſture, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 3.5. Pride you ſee ſtains the whole man, ſoul and body; that primarily, this ſecondarily; yet (you ſay) the waſhing of the feet ſhews the cleanſing of them every whit, as well as if the whole body had been waſhed. Therefore the waſhing of one part, ſignifies the waſhing of the whole; unleſs Mr. <hi>Haggar</hi> think that pride is onely in the feet; becauſe we ſay, proud people are high in the In-ſtep, and ſtand upon their Pantofles.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That waſhing of the feet ſhewed more then humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; <hi>Peter</hi> then did not know it,<note place="margin">Joh. 13.7. See <hi>Calvin</hi> in loc.</note> and Mr. <hi>Haggar</hi> doth not, or will not yet ſee it: for it ſhews either pardon of ſin, or newneſs of life, or both. Now if juſtification and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication are ſignified elſwhere by ſprinkling, why not alſo by our powring on water, or as you call it, ſprinkling wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on the childs face? Thus we have <hi>Exemplum Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum,</hi> that a partial waſhing may ſignifie a total pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As Chriſt did not ſay, He that believs, and is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized on his feet, ſhall be ſaved; ſo he doth not ſay, Hee that believs, and is dipped over head and ears, ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, every whit. If you Reply, he ſaith, he that is baptized, <hi>i. e.</hi> that is all one with Dipped: That's but a miſerable begging of the Queſtion, and it remains to be proved; though I leave it to be conſidered, whether it be proper to ſay, Baptized on his feet; unleſs it bee Mr. <hi>Haggar's</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice

                  <p n="7">7. If they who are baptized, are Dipp'd in their cloaths as there is no Scripture for ſo doing, ſo it's againſt your principle. For to Dip (in your ſenſe) is to plunge a perſon over head and ears in water, ſo as immediately to be wet; but he that is Dipp'd in his cloaths is not immediately wet all over. For his cloaths are Dipp'd primarily, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, hee ſecondarily and mediately; his cloaths by the water, he by his cloaths.

                  <p n="2">2. You tell us of naked <hi>Peter,</hi> but do not tell us the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked truth. <hi>Peter</hi> was not naked (in your ſenſe) the word ſomtimes ſignifies to be without any bodily covering, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.25 Secondly poor and mean clothing, <hi>Job.</hi> 22.6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25 36. The poor members of Chriſt are ſaid to bee naked, as well as <hi>Peter,</hi> and I do not think (whatſoever you do) that they were <hi>Adamites.</hi> Thirdly, them who have layd aſide their upper garment, as <hi>Saul</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.24. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 20.2. Thus <hi>Peter</hi> was naked; for neither his calling (as a Fiſher) doth neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that he was ſimply without covering; neither doth the modeſty of a man, much leſs the gravity of an Apoſtle permit it, nor doth it ſuit with the cuſtom of the Jews, who was wont to wear a looſe upper garment, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put off, it was uſuall to ſay, they were naked. Thus your anſwer is pure Quakeriſm.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. No truly pious, or morally honeſt man, but will judg it an immodeſt act for men to go ſtark naked (in your ſenſe). There are <hi>Pudenda naturae,</hi> which God and nature would have covered, and to diſcover them is immodeſty, (unleſs upon inevitable neceſſity), why elſe did the ſons of <hi>Noah</hi> go backward with a mantle to cover their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers nakedneſs? <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.22, 23.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If you will have your own ſaying, <hi>viz.</hi> It is not an immodeſt thing for men to be naked together, yet ſure it is for men and women; ſuch mix'd Dipping is no more

                  <p n="5">5. Whether M. <hi>Baxter</hi> will allow, that men may go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the water to bath them, yet not ſin? let thoſe who have read the former anſwer judge. If men may, why may not women? conſider that ſad ſtory of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.2.4.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. You bewray the ſubtilty of the Serpent, you menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bathing, but intend baptizing. That is at the top, like the corn ſpread over the well, but this (like the ſcouts) lyes at the bottom, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.19. This water-man looks one way, and rowes another: But if it were granted, it is not immodeſt for men to bath together, yet it's indecent for them to be baptized naked. For, is there no difference between bathing and baptizing? Where is the honour of the Ordinance? Is that comly and lawful in Sacramentals, which is uſuall in morals? <hi>e. g.</hi> At our Tables we laugh, &amp;c. may we therefore do ſo at the Lord's Table? <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10.16. Secondly, doth it not trench upon the purity of the Lord Jeſus, that he ſhould inſtitute a ſtanding Ordinance in his Church, that is very diſputable whether it be a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs or not? What? only a pair of ſhears between a Goſpel-Sacrament, and a grievous ſin? and for all your Sophiſtry, you cannot tell which is the finer end. I am ſure, you do not plainly determine it? Thirdly, doth not this tax Chriſt of inconſideration, that Chriſt ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute an Ordinance, at the adminiſtration of which all believers may not be preſent, men not ſee women, nor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſee men Dipped?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. If it were granted that men apart and women apart may be baptized, who then ſhall Dip the women?

                        <hi>H. H.</hi> Now for treachery; let them remember M. <hi>Love,</hi> who was beheaded for a Traitour; and for Perjury, it's eaſie to prove most of the Prieſts of <hi>England</hi> perjured, in renouncing the Biſhops in their orders, which once they took an Oath to bee true to; and for ſedition, it's manifeſt to all that hear them praying, or preaching; and for Idleneſs, they know not how to work, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply</hi> 1. When you were on the Kings party— I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev you would not have call'd M. <hi>Love</hi> a traitor; I am ſure thoſe <hi>London</hi> Miniſters, who ſet forth ſom of <hi>L.</hi> books, ſince his death, have a better opinion of him, then you have here. If you were not partiall, your Apology for M. <hi>Dennis</hi> (in your <hi>p.</hi> preceding) might more fitly and truly ſerve here.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For Perjury (to ſay nothing of your ſcornful terms) when you have proved the Biſhops calling, and their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to be lawfull according to the Word, wee will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs our perjury; till then, you might have forborn this Calumny; an unlawfull oath is voyd <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> it being a ſin to make it, it muſt needs be a greater to keep it. It had been better for <hi>Herod</hi> to have broken, then to have kept his Oath. No Oath is the bond of iniquity. And it's falſe, that our orders are renounced, except by ſuch as you are: it's maintained as a reall truth, that Biſhops did Ordain, not as Biſhops, but as preaching Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters; and though we have renounced Epiſcopacy, yet not our Orders, we ſee no need.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For ſedition, the witneſſes you produce (for you are neither eye-witneſſe. nor ear-witneſſe) can prove you an accuſer of the brethren, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.10. We do not uſe to ſhoot wild-fire from our Pulpits. The Anabaptiſts are the ſons of <hi>Bichri,</hi> that blow the trumpet of Sedition. How many ſeditious Pamphlets have of late been printed by them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Lord Protector,</hi> and preſent Government? Is not their way of thriving, by ſetting Church and State on a
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:119011:150"/>flame? as if <hi>Salamander</hi>-like they delight to live In the fire (their proper element). What an Incendiary was <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden?</hi> This miſerably divided Church can ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly witneſs what ſtirs they have made.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For Idleneſs, I wonder you are not aſhamed to call us idle; is there no calling, but mechanicall? no labour, but Digging, threſhing, &amp;c. Did the Apoſtle mean a trade, when he ſaid he laboured more abundantly then they all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. Or doth he mean carting and plowing, or any handy-craft or civill imployment, when he ſaith, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially they who labour in the Word and Doctrine, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17.

This will be certainly done, if prople be deprived of right Tranſlations and Interpretations of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which muſt needs be wanting, if there be no Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor Learned men.

Therefore 1. Where is it written, that it is a ſin to plead Humane Learning, next to grace, to be the glory of our Miniſtry. To uſe your own words in the next <hi>pag. If there be ſuch a place, let us ſee it; but if there be not, for ſhame leave this idle fantaſtical reaſoning.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. That Humane learning (ſanctified) is a glorious ornament to us, and our Miniſtry, none but inhumane and illiterate men can deny; ſince it's no ſmall piece of <hi>Moſes</hi> his honor, that he was learned in all the wiſdome of the Egyptians (as was ſaid before) <hi>i. e.</hi> in Mathematicks and Phyſicks, &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 6 22. as Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> ſhews.

                     <hi>Reply</hi> 1. The greateſt part of this Section is not the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and of the holy Scriptures, but of <hi>Aſhdod,</hi> and of the <hi>Quakers;</hi> who being once members of your Church, have ſince charged you to your face to preach for hire, &amp;c. as you charge us. Is it therefore ſo indeed? I would have you know, that maintenance is neither the cauſe of our preaching, nor the end of our preaching. Nor that which guides, orders, and regulates our preaching, and ſo dear is our calling to us, and ſo precious are the ſouls of our people, that if maintenance ſhould fail, wee would preach the Goſpel, though we beg our bread.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It's ſtrange to me that you ſay, we cannot digg, when you poſitively charge Mr. <hi>C. p.</hi> 121. (and there is the ſame reaſon of others) that he had taken great pains to dig for gold out of the mountains of Antient Fathers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. You anſwer your ſelf, in ſaying, for the <hi>most part</hi> God did chuſe his Prophets out of unlearned men, &amp;c. Therefore not alwaies, by your own grant. But Sir,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:119011:162"/>though extraordinary Prophets and Preachers were for the moſt part ſo choſen, yet the Prieſts and Levites were not. The Lord by his prerogative royal may chuſe whom he pleaſeth, who of Shepherds, Herdſmen, Fiſher-men, &amp;c. made Prophets or Apoſtles—will you therefore preſume (unleſſe you be God's Ape) to ordain Tanners, and Tai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, Nailors, and Cheeſe-factors to the office of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? will you make an ordinary practice of extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry preſidents? when you can ſhew us ſuch a warrant, we will believe; till then, we believe you are a Deceiver.</p>

May not any man preach and declare the Word by your doctrine? Nay, why did you write, print, and publiſh this Book, if you had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to do, but to believe and obey that Word, &amp;c.

               <p>H. H. Secondly, <hi>your Rantizing or Cozening of poor babes in their Cradles take away that, and you have no Church.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply</hi> 1. How many crude Allegations do you here aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, without any proof at all; as that we Rantize babes, nay cozen them, nay, in their Cradles, &amp;c. all which are as truly denied by us, as they are confidently (yet barely) affirmed by you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If baptiſm (according to your Doctrines confuted) be eſſentiall to conſtitute a Church; then take away that, and we have no Church: but the Antecedent is falſe, and therefore the Conſequent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If by others, you mean the Anabaptiſts, I deny that you or they have faithfully preached the Goſpell. (wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed the many errours vented by them, and diſcovered to be ſuch in this book) or that you have converted ſouls to the faith, I never heard of an ignorant profane perſon, wrought upon by your Miniſtry, only you build on our foundation, and gather where you never ſcattered, ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſimple and unſtable ſouls.</p>
               <p n="4">4. How pitifully do you again contradict your ſelf? For if you have a far greater Church then we, how is it that we have no Church? If <hi>Goliah</hi> be a greater man then <hi>David,</hi> doth that hold out that <hi>David</hi> is no man?</p>
               <p n="5">5. I ſuppoſe you mean, that Infant-Baptiſm is one of our pillars, on which our Church ſtands; The anſwer to the

And therefore let the Reader compare your Anſwer, and this Reply together, and judge accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.
